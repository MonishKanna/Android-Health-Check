# Android Health Check Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Android Health Check project! This repository contains code for a Machine Learning project aimed at predicting android operating system health-related outcomes based on a dataset with 215 features and 1 target variable.

## Data Preprocessing

- **Features:** 215
- **Target Variable:** 1

The dataset has undergone preprocessing, including handling missing values by replacing them with NaN and subsequently dropping those rows.

## Feature Selection

To enhance model efficiency and interpretability, the top 30 features were selected using the SelectKBest function.

## Data Splitting

The dataset was divided into training and testing sets with an 80-20 split, respectively.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

The following machine learning algorithms were employed to build predictive models:

1. Random Forest Classifier
2. Gradient Boosting Classifier
3. Support Vector Machine - Linear Kernel
4. Support Vector Machine - RBF Kernel
5. K-Nearest Neighbors
6. Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier
7. Gaussian Naive Bayes
8. Logistic Regression
9. Decision Tree Classifier
10. Adaptive Boosting Classifier
11. XGBoost Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics

For each algorithm, the model performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve

These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance and its ability to predict health outcomes accurately.
